## Goals/requirements
### Goals
- A working server (raspberry pi) that collects votes and serves a website to guide voting device registration and final vote tally.
- The system shall support anonymous and registered voting.
- The system shall be as self explanatory and simple to use as possible. (A HR person should be able to handle it without a 30 minute lecture :) )
- The voting device shall be as power efficient as possible.
- Scalable (The voting remotes shall be plug and play)
